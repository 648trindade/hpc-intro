start: true
questions:
- "What are the different ways in which we can use resources in parallel?"
- "What implications do different parallel models have for performance and my use of HPC?"
- "How do I use different parallel strategies on an HPC system?"
objectives:
- "Be able to describe different approaches to parallelisation."
- "Identify how different approaches impact your use of an HPC system."
